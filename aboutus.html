                        <p> "I enjoy offering encouraging, uplifting, and mainly scriptural-based home, office, and church decor. I have named my buisness based on my favorite Bible Verse, Psalm 18:3 - God is my refuge, my stronghold - Even when you are barely holding on by a thread, God is our stronghold. I hope you will find strength  and encouragement through these decorative pieces. I want to offer decor that helps others promote and teach scripture to their families and as a gift to their friends and loved ones. I want every StrongholdScripts piece to be a unique and special gift that you will treasure." - <i> Ashley Adams, Buisness Owner </i> </p>
